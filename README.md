# GPACalculator
A simple program that calculates user's GPA on a 4.0 scale.
User responses are recorded in the terminal. 
The program works by asking how many classes a user has taken, and asks the course credit number and grade for each of these classes.
After the program has received all of the necessary information, it does some simple math to calculate the user's GPA.
Note: it only calculates on a 4.0 GPA scale. Updates to work with different grading systems may come.
